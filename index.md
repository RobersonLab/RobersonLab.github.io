<p><em>
Our lab is interested in characterizing the genetics underlying human disease risk using sporadic cases, extreme phenotypes and familial disease clusters. We assess the effect of such variation using a combination of genetics, molecular biology, statistics and bioinformatics. Our main interests are inflammatory and autoimmune diseases.

<h1>What do we research?</h1>

<h2>Hidradenitis suppurativa</h2>
Our primary research is focused on hidradenitis suppurativa (HS), a chronic skin disease. The first outbreaks are usually during early adulthood, and result in the formation of multiple abscesses in apocrine gland-rich skin folds. This includes under the arms, beneath the breasts and in the groin. The molecular etiology is not well understood despite a relatively high prevalence and large number of familial disease clusters. We collaborate with  Drs. Peter Nagele and Milan Anadkat for patient recruitment and clinical research.

<h2>Collaborations</h2>
We have numerous interlab collaborations studying areas such as the genetics of rare variants in thrombotic and hemolytic disease, familial autoimmunity, and dermatomyositis.

<h1>Jobs</h1>
<strong>**Currently we have no salary funded positions available**</strong>

<h1>Code</h1>
We use statistics and bioinformatics techniques in our research. For statistical analysis we primarily rely on R, and for scripting and programming we tend to use python and C++. You can locate code that we have found useful on the lab <a href="http://github.com/robersonlab">GitHub</a> site.

<h1>RDCC Genetics Core</h1>
Eli co-directs the Genetics Core component of the Washington University Rheumatic Disease Core Center with a focus on human genetics and molecular biology. We can provide general advice, experimental design assistance, data analysis, long-term data storage and contract lab work. Priority will be given to projects related to Rheumatic disease. A portion of lab effort is offset by the Core to provide protected time to collaborate with other laboratories. Please contact us if you would like to discuss potential projects.
